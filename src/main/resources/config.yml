# Every x seconds, chunks around each player online are flagged.
# Flags prevent deletion for a configurable amount of time, allowing
# players to prevent areas from being deleted simply by being active.
#
# Default values cause a 9x9 chunk (144x144 blocks) around players to be
# flagged every 10 seconds. This means that unless players exceed a travel
# speed of 14.4 m/s chunks will be continuously flagged as they pass.
# For more information on travel speeds, please check the Minecraft wiki.

  # Chunks are automatically flagged as visited when generated.
  # If true, the flag is set to a special value that will be overwritten once
  # a player actually visits the area. This allows you to reduce load by
  # pre-generating area for exploration and not deleting unvisited areas.
  # Note that flagging must be enabled in worlds (days-till-flag-expires > 0).

# Debug-level enables more and more verbose logging of actions as increased.

# HIGH - Lots of debug messages. Don't enable this unless you have a serious issue - excessive logging causes lag.
